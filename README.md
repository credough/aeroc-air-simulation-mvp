### See the Air, Breathe Aware
Track, simulate, and protect yourself from harmful particles in the air you breathe.

AeroC is a web-based platform developed during the **AWS Solar Power Hackathon 2025**, held at **Arthaland Century Pacific Tower** on August 18, 2025. The project empowers individuals and communities by providing real-time tracking and visualization of air pollution levels using cloud-powered infrastructure.

## Problem Statement

Air pollution poses a severe threat to global health and ecosystems. Harmful particles and gases—whether natural or man-made—pollute the air we breathe. According to the State of Global Air 2024 Report, air pollution is one of the leading environmental threats to human well-being, contributing to **8.1 million deaths globally** each year.

Communities need an accessible, real-time tool that helps them become aware of risks and make informed decisions to protect themselves.

## Our Solution: AeroC

**AeroC** is a **web-based air quality monitoring platform** that allows users to visualize, track, and understand harmful particles in their surroundings. It helps users make informed decisions by providing:

- Real-time particle tracking  
- Pollutant simulation and insights  
- User-friendly visualization  
- Awareness tools that promote environmental health  

> **See the Air, Breathe Aware!**  
> Track, Simulate, and Protect Yourself from Harmful Particles.
